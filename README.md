# Module-5-Challenge

Welcome to my submission 5. 
This submission looks into the data from Pymaceuticals Inc, where we analyse the performance of cancer treatments on mice across four main treatments.
We have analysed data by merging two separate resources into a single data set. 
From here we have generated a summary statistics and created a series of graphs to help explain the performance of the treatments. 
We dove into quartiles to find outliers in the results. 
Lastly we looked into scaterplots, correlation and regression functions. 

We concluded with three statements providing insights intot he results. 
Three Conclussions:

Based on the box plots, Infubinol had the greatest final tumor size.


There seems to be a possitive correlation between average tumor volume and moise weight for those treated by Capomulin.


By the final time point, mice I509 had experienced a rapid decline in tumor volume following by a slight increase.
